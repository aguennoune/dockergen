  description: |
    Tries to detect a squid deb proxy on a provided ip address and use it to
    speed up `docker build'.
    Usage:
      ip=1.2.3.4 port=1234 find_squid_deb_proxy
      # or the more readable alternative, provided by `set -k':
      detect_squid_deb_proxy ip=1.2.3.4 port=1234
    Notes:
      - `ip' defaults to the default gateway ip address which presumably is the
        docker host.
      - `port' defaults to squid-deb-proxy's default port: 8000.
      - detecting the default gateway requires `nc' and `iproute2`. This snippet
        unconditionally installs `netcat-openbsd' since docker base images for
        ubuntu 12.04 do not come with nc. `iproute2' is present on all ubuntu
        base images.

  description: |
    Install Composer under /usr/share/composer.
    Notes:
    - Composer expects to find either COMPOSER_HOME or HOME in the environment.
      Since `docker build` and `docker run` operate in non-login shells, we set
      COMPOSER_HOME here.
    - Non-root users in logins shells still can use Composer, but they will not
      have access to the root user's globally required packages in `/root/vendor`.
    - See https://getcomposer.org/download/
  dockerfile: |
    RUN mkdir -p /usr/share/composer
    ENV COMPOSER_HOME /root
    RUN wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar -O /usr/local/bin/composer
    RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer
